This plugin allows users to be authenticated via CAS, and logins to be controlled via LDAP.

== Description ==

This plugin allows users to be authenticated via CAS, and logins to be controlled via LDAP. Default user roles can be assigned based on LDAP group membership, and accounts can be auto-created for users that exist in LDAP, but not yet in WordPress.

It assumes that, for CAS authentication, the user is redirected to an outside address, then back to the referring address; that's how it works where I'm at :-). You can also specify a group in LDAP that will always have admin privileges; useful for tech staff.

Before the plugin is used, the constants in `soj-ldap_constants.inc.php` must be filled out. The CAS default password is the one the user is registered with in WordPress; so all WP users will have this password. I did this because, where I am, we do not, and cannot, have access to the passwords the users use to authenticate through CAS, and I didn't want them having to input a separate password for WordPress. Assuming the plugin is always used for login, (as it is for me) it shouldn't matter, because the WP password is never used. If the plugin is disabled, however, users who know the password can log in as anyone. Be aware of that. There is obviously more that could be done there, but, for me, it's enough. I'm happy to work with others who have ideas, though.

I've only ever used this plugin on one environment, so it might not work out-of-the-box for you. I'm interested in making this plugin more robust, however, so please let me know of any issues.
